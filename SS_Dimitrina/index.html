    <h3>Calculate Your Calorie Intake</h3>
    <p>
    The total number of calories a person needs each day varies depending on a number of factors,
    including the person’s age, gender, height, weight, and level of physical activity.
    In addition, a need to lose, maintain, or gain weight and other factors affect how many calories
    should be consumed. Estimated amounts of calories needed to maintain calorie balance for various
    age groups by gender at five different levels of physical activity.
    </p>
    <p>
    To create your own personal program you need to calculate your daily calorie requirements. Not everybody needs
    2,000 calories a day (as many people consider) - your needs are highly individual and determined by much more
    than your workouts.
    </p>
    <p>
    Use now the calorie calculator for recommended daily intake to see your individual needs for maintaining
    weight and count your consumed calories.

    <h3>Learn More About Your Body Mass Index and Calculate It</h3>
    <p>The index of body mass gives you a general idea of where body weight should be, determining a healthy body
        weight.
    </p>
    <p>Basically the BMI assumes a "normal" body weight for men and women of average height and average fitness or
        activity
        level. It is important to take all this into account when trying to understand your BMI reading and also speak with a
        doctor
        or nutritionist before undergoing any new fitness routine or diet. One last thing to remember is that the
        "overweight",
        "underweight" readings shown in this BMI calculator are relative to a pre-defined average "normal" body weight.
        This means that for bodybuilders and very fit people, sometimes it’s better being "overweight" because to them
        the BMI is stating they are heavier than "normal" people, which is in fact the goal most bodybuilders want to
        obtain.
