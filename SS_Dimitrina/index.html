  <h3>Calculate Your Caloric Intake</h3>
    <p>To create your own personal program you need to calculate your daily calorie requirements. 
      Not everybody needs 2,000 calories a day - your needs are highly individual and determined by much more than your workouts.
    </p>
    <p>This depends on numerous factors. These include age, height, current weight, activity levels, metabolic health and several others.

<div class="paragraph">
  <h3>Calculate Your Body Mass Index</h3>
    <p>The index of body mass gives you a general idea of where body weight should be, determining a healthy body weight.</p>
    <p>Basically the BMI assumes a "normal" body weight for men and women of average height and average fitness or activity level.</p>
    <p>It is important to take all this into account when trying to understand your BMI reading and also speak with a doctor
       or nutritionist before undergoing any new fitness routine or diet. One last thing to remember is that the "overweight", "underweight"
        readings shown in this BMI calculator are relative to a pre-defined average "normal" body weight. This means that for bodybuilders and 
        very fit people, sometimes it’s better being "overweight" because to them the BMI is stating they are heavier than "normal" people, which 
        is in fact the goal most bodybuilders want to obtain.</p>
