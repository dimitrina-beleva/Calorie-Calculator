<h3>Key Recommendations</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
      The initial goal of weight-loss therapy should be to reduce body weight by about 10 percent from baseline. With success, and if warranted, further weight loss can be attempted.
  </li>
  <li>
      The combination of a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity is recommended, because it produces weight loss that also may result in decreases in abdominal fat and increases in cardiorespiratory fitness.
  </li>
  <li>
      Weight loss should be about 1 to 2 pounds per week for a period of 6 months, with the subsequent strategy based on the amount of weight lost.
  </li>
  <li>
      A diet that is individually planned to help create a deficit of 500 to 1,000 kcal/day should be an intregal part of any program aimed at achieving a weight loss of 1 to 2 pounds per week.
  </li>
  <li>
      Reducing dietary fat alone without reducing calories is not sufficient for weight loss. However, reducing dietary fat, along with reducing dietary carbohydrates, can help reduce calories.
  </li>
  <li>
      Physical activity should be an integral part of weight-loss therapy and weight maintenance. Initially, moderate levels of physical activity for 30 to 45 minutes, 3 to 5 days a week, should be encouraged. All adults should set a long-term goal to accumulate at least 30 minutes or more of moderate-intensity physical activity on most, and preferably all, days of the week.
  </li>
  <li>
      Physical activity should be part of a comprehensive weight loss therapy and weight control program because it (1) modestly contributes to weight loss in overweight and obese adults, (2) may decrease abdominal fat, (3) increases cardiorespiratory fitness, and (4) may help with maintenance of weight loss.
  </li>
  <li>
      Behavior therapy is a useful adjunct when incorporated into treatment for weight loss and weight maintenance.
  </li>
  <li>
      Weight-loss and weight-maintenance therapy should employ the combination of LCDs, increased physical activity, and behavior therapy.
  </li>
  <li>
      After successful weight loss, the likelihood of weight-loss maintenance is enhanced by a program consisting of dietary therapy, physical activity, and behavior therapy, which should be continued indefinitely. Drug therapy also can be used. However, drug safety and efficacy beyond 1 year of total treatment have not been established.
  </li>
  <li>
    A weight maintenance program should be a priority after the initial 6 months of weight-loss therapy.
  </li>

</ol>
