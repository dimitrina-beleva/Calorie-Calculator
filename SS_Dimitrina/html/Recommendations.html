<h3 id="recommendation1">Eating More Protein Can Reduce Appetite, Cut Cravings by 60% and Increase The Amount of Calories You Burn</h3>
<p>
        When it comes to losing weight, protein is the king of nutrients.

        Adding protein to your diet is the simplest, most effective and most delicious way to lose weight with minimal effort.
        
        Studies show that protein both increases your metabolic rate and helps curb your appetite.
        
        Because protein requires energy to metabolize, a high protein diet can increase calories burned by up to 80 to 100 calories per day.
    </p>
    <p>
        
        Protein is also the most filling nutrient, by far. One study showed that people who ate 30% of calories as protein automatically ate 441 fewer calories per day.
        
        In other words, you can easily increase calories out and reduce calories in... just by adding protein to your diet.
        
        Protein can also help fight cravings, which are the dieter's worst enemy.
        
        In one study, 25% of calories as protein reduced obsessive thoughts about food by 60% and cut the desire for late-night snacking by 50%.
        
        If you want to lose weight, sustainably, with minimal effort, then consider making a permanent increase in your protein intake.
        
        Not only will it help you lose, it will also prevent or at least significantly reduce weight regain, in case you ever decide to abandon your weight loss efforts.
        
        For more details, read this in-depth article about how much protein you should eat.

    <div class="recommendations">
<h3 id="recommendation2">Avoid Sugary Soft Drinks (and Fruit Juices), The Most Fattening Items in The Modern Diet</h3>
<p>
        Another relatively easy change you can make, is to eliminate liquid sugar calories from your diet.

        This includes sodas, fruit juices, chocolate milk and other beverages that have sugar in them.
        
        These "foods" are probably the most fattening aspect of the modern diet, by far.
        
        This is because liquid calories don't get "registered" by the brain in the same way as solid calories.
    </p>
    <p>
        
        For this reason, drinking sugary soda doesn't make your brain automatically compensate by having you eat less of other things instead.
        
        Studies have shown that sugary drinks are strongly linked to an increased risk of obesity, with one study in children showing a 60% increased risk for each daily serving of a sugar-sweetened beverage.
        
        Of course, the harmful effects of sugar go way beyond just weight gain. It can have disastrous effects on metabolic health and raise your risk of all sorts of diseases.
        
        Although small amounts of natural sugars from foods (like fruit) are absolutely fine, large amounts from added sugar and sugary drinks can be an absolute disaster.
        
        There is absolutely NO physiological need for these beverages and the long-term benefits of avoiding them can be enormous.

<div class="recommendations">
<h3 id="recommendation3">Drinking More Water Can Help With Weight Loss</h3>
<p>
        One very simple trick to increase weight loss is to drink more water.

        This can increase the number of calories you burn for up to 90 minutes.
        
        Drinking about 2 liters (68 ounces, or 8 glasses) of water per day can make you burn about 96 more calories per day.
    </p>
    <p>
        
        But when you drink water may be even more important, because having it before meals can help reduce hunger and make you automatically eat fewer calories.
        
        In one study, drinking a half liter (17 ounces) of water a half hour before meals made people lose 44% more weight over a period of 12 weeks.
        
        When combined with a healthy diet, drinking more water (especially before meals) does appear to be helpful if you need to lose weight.
        
        Caffeinated beverages such as coffee and green tea are also excellent. The caffeine in them can help boost metabolism somewhat, at least in the short term.
    </p>

<div class="recommendations">
<h3 id="recommendation4">Do Some Exercise and Lift Weights</h3>
<p>
        When we eat fewer calories, our bodies compensate by making us burn less.

        This is why long-term calorie restriction can significantly reduce metabolism.
        
        Not only that, but it can also lead to loss of muscle mass. Muscle is metabolically active, so this can reduce metabolism even further.
        
        Pretty much the only proven strategy to prevent this from happening is to exert your muscles by lifting weights.
        
        This has been repeatedly shown to prevent muscle loss and prevent your metabolism from slowing down during long-term calorie restriction.
        
    </p>
    <p>
        Of course, we don't want to just lose fat... we want to make sure that what is beneath also looks good.
        
        If you can't get to a gym, then consider doing some body weight exercises like push ups, squats, sit ups, etc.
        
        Doing some cardio like walking, swimming or jogging can also be important. Not so much for weight loss, but for optimal health and general wellbeing.
        
        Of course, exercise also has a plethora of other benefits that go way beyond just weight loss... such as a longer life, lower risk of disease, more energy and feeling better every day
    </p>

    <br>
    <div class="recommendations">
<h3 id="recommendation5">Reduce Carbohydrate Intake, Especially Refined Carbs and Sugars</h3>
<p>
    Cutting carbs is a very effective way to lose weight.

    When people do that, their appetite tends to go down and they eat fewer calories automatically.

    Studies have shown that eating a low-carb diet until fullness can make you lose about 2-3 times as much weight as a calorie restricted low-fat diet.
        
    Not only that, but low-carb diets also have all sorts of other benefits for health, especially for people with type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome.
        
    But if you don't want to go low-carb, then that's fine too. Just make sure you eat quality, fiber-rich carbohydrate sources... from whole, single ingredient foods.
        
    If you stick to real foods, the exact composition of your diet becomes less important.
