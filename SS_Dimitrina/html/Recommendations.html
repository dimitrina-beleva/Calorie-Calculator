        <h3 id="recommendation1">Eating More Protein Can Reduce Appetite, Cut Cravings by 60% and Increase The Amount of Calories You Burn</h3>
        <p>
            When it comes to losing weight, protein is the king of nutrients. Adding protein to your diet is the simplest, most effective
            and most delicious way to lose weight with minimal effort. Studies show that protein both increases your metabolic
            rate and helps curb your appetite. Because protein requires energy to metabolize, a high protein diet can increase
            calories burned by up to 80 to 100 calories per day. Protein is also the most filling nutrient, by far. One study
            showed that people who ate 30% of calories as protein automatically ate 441 fewer calories per day. In other
            words, you can easily increase calories out and reduce calories in... just by adding protein to your diet.
        </p>
        <div id="hiddenInfoProtein" class="hidden-info">
            <p>
                Protein can also help fight cravings, which are the dieter's worst enemy. In one study, 25% of calories as protein reduced
                obsessive thoughts about food by 60% and cut the desire for late-night snacking by 50%. If you want to lose
                weight, sustainably, with minimal effort, then consider making a permanent increase in your protein intake.
                Not only will it help you lose, it will also prevent or at least significantly reduce weight regain, in case
                you ever decide to abandon your weight loss efforts.
            </p>
            <p>
                The “thermic effect of food” (TEF) is the energy we use to digest food into small, absorbable components. Protein has a higher
                TEF compared to carbs and fat meaning you’re actually burning more calories to process protein than to process
                the other two. It may be surprising, but it is a scientific fact that your body cannot effectively burn and
                use fat as energy if it doesn’t have help from either carbohydrate or protein. As you are losing weight,
                your body loses both muscle and fat. During this process it is especially important that you continue to
                eat enough protein in your diet. Having adequate protein coming in from your food fuels fat burning while
                preserving calorie-burning lean muscle.

        </h3>
        <p>
            Another relatively easy change you can make, is to eliminate liquid sugar calories from your diet. This includes sodas, fruit
            juices, chocolate milk and other beverages that have sugar in them. These "foods" are probably the most fattening
            aspect of the modern diet, by far. This is because liquid calories don't get "registered" by the brain in the
            same way as solid calories. For this reason, drinking sugary soda doesn't make your brain automatically compensate
            by having you eat less of other things instead. Studies have shown that sugary drinks are strongly linked to
            an increased risk of obesity, with one study in children showing a 60% increased risk for each daily serving
            of a sugar-sweetened beverage. Strong evidence indicates that sugar-sweetened soft drinks contribute to the development
            of diabetes.
        </p>
        <div id="hiddenAvoidSugary" class="hidden-info">
            <p>
                It can have disastrous effects on metabolic health and raise your risk of all sorts of diseases. Although small amounts of
                natural sugars from foods (like fruit) are absolutely fine, large amounts from added sugar and sugary drinks
                can be an absolute disaster. There is absolutely NO physiological need for these beverages and the long-term
                benefits of avoiding them can be enormous.
            </p>
            <p>
                Drinks such as cordial, soft drinks, sports drinks, fruit juice drinks and flavoured mineral waters, all contain a lot of
                sugar and kilojoules. Pure fruit juice also contains a lot of sugar. And even though it’s a natural sugar
                rather than refined sugar, it still represents a significant number of kilojoules. So it’s always best to
                save these kinds of drinks for special occasions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Eating whole fruit is always better than consuming pure fruit juice or fruit juice drinks. Whole fruit contains both vitamins
                and fibre, and is more filling than juice. So when your kids eat whole fruits, they’re getting less sugar,
                and at the same time, more nutritional benefit.

        <h3 id="recommendation3">Drinking More Water Can Help With Weight Loss</h3>
        <p>
            One very simple trick to increase weight loss is to drink more water. This can increase the number of calories you burn for
            up to 90 minutes. Drinking about 2 liters (68 ounces, or 8 glasses) of water per day can make you burn about
            96 more calories per day. But when you drink water may be even more important, because having it before meals
            can help reduce hunger and make you automatically eat fewer calories. In one study, drinking a half liter (17
            ounces) of water a half hour before meals made people lose 44% more weight over a period of 12 weeks. When combined
            with a healthy diet, drinking more water (especially before meals) does appear to be helpful if you need to lose
            weight. Caffeinated beverages such as coffee and green tea are also excellent. The caffeine in them can help
            boost metabolism somewhat, at least in the short term.
        </p>
        <div id="hiddenMoreWater" class="hidden-info">
            <p>
                The amount of water people need per day is up for debate, but studies suggest adults need nine to 16 cups of H2O. However
                this number varies depending on activity level, age, and how much water people are consuming in coffee, tea,
                or water-rich veggies and fruit. Here’s how to keep yourself hydrated: Begin by drinking a glass of water
                as soon as you wake up, and 30 minutes before eating any big meal (This will help control appetite, too).
                Get in the habit of keeping a water bottle on hand at all times. And if the taste beings to bore, spice up
                the taste buds with a squeeze of citrus to the glass! Before you know it, all the benefits of water will
                be right at your fingertips… and in your body.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sweating at the gym causes muscles to lose water. And when the muscles don’t have enough water, they get tired. So for extra
                energy, try drinking water to push through that final set of squats.

        <h3 id="recommendation4">Do Some Exercise and Lift Weights</h3>
        <p>
            When we eat fewer calories, our bodies compensate by making us burn less. This is why long-term calorie restriction can significantly
            reduce metabolism. Not only that, but it can also lead to loss of muscle mass. Muscle is metabolically active,
            so this can reduce metabolism even further. Pretty much the only proven strategy to prevent this from happening
            is to exert your muscles by lifting weights. This has been repeatedly shown to prevent muscle loss and prevent
            your metabolism from slowing down during long-term calorie restriction. Stop whining, start moving, and you’ll
            immediately begin to feel that energy bump and get through the day with less fatigue.
        </p>
        <div id="hiddenDoExercise" class="hidden-info">
            <p>
                Of course, we don't want to just lose fat... we want to make sure that what is beneath also looks good. If you can't get
                to a gym, then consider doing some body weight exercises like push ups, squats, sit ups, etc. Doing some
                cardio like walking, swimming or jogging can also be important. Not so much for weight loss, but for optimal
                health and general wellbeing. Of course, exercise also has a plethora of other benefits that go way beyond
                just weight loss... such as a longer life, lower risk of disease, more energy and feeling better every day.
            </p>
            <p>
                A few studies have found that physically fit kids perform better on standardized tests, though more research needs to be
                done on the topic. Even moderate walking helps boost cognitive functions like reasoning, memory, attention
                span, and the expansion of information and knowledge. Keep your neurons in shape as well as your booty.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you exercise you feel better, you look better, you get stronger, you feel a sense of accomplishment, and that rush of
                endorphins has a ripple effect on everything you do. When you feel better, you feel empowered and more confident.
                Win-win!

        <h3 id="recommendation5">Reduce Carbohydrate Intake, Especially Refined Carbs and Sugars</h3>
        <p>
            Cutting carbs is a very effective way to lose weight. When people do that, their appetite tends to go down and they eat fewer
            calories automatically. Studies have shown that eating a low-carb diet until fullness can make you lose about
            2-3 times as much weight as a calorie restricted low-fat diet. Not only that, but low-carb diets also have all
            sorts of other benefits for health, especially for people with type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome. But if
            you don't want to go low-carb, then that's fine too. Just make sure you eat quality, fiber-rich carbohydrate
            sources... from whole, single ingredient foods. If you stick to real foods, the exact composition of your diet
            becomes less important.
        </p>
        <div id="hiddenReduceCarbs" class="hidden-info">
            <p>
                Carbs are classified as complex (starches and fiber) and simple (sugar). They are found in grains, fruits, vegetables, and
                milk. Most vegetables are relatively low in carbs, and shellfish contain small amounts of carb. When carbs
                are digested, they break into small particles of sugar (galactose, glucose, and fructose) that enter through
                the small intestine into the blood stream, then to the liver where they are converted into glucose (sugar).
                Glucose is the primary energy that fuels muscles and the brain. Excess glucose is stored as glycogen in the
                liver and muscles. When the body reaches storage capacity for glycogen, glucose is stored as fat. This is
                why eating too many carbs can lead to weight gain. Thus, the body needs carbs to function properly. However,
                most people consume far more carbs than they need.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not all carbs are created equal. Complex carbs include whole grains and whole fruits and vegetables, which all contain lots
                of fiber and vital phytonutrients. Fiber is digested and converted to glucose slowly, which helps to keep
                the blood sugar levels in check. Simple carbs, on the other hand, include pre-processed foods (such as refined
                white flour), white sugar, and fruit juices without any pulp. Simple carbs are digested very quickly and
                can cause a spike in your blood sugar. When eating carbs, opt for complex carbs to get the most benefit from
                fiber and other phytonutrients from the plants.
