    <h3>Body Mass Index (BMI)</h3>
    <p>BMI is a useful measure of overweight and obesity. It is calculated from your height and weight. BMI is an
        estimate of body fat and a good gauge of your risk for diseases that can occur with more body fat. The higher
        your BMI, the higher your risk for certain diseases such as heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes,
        gallstones, breathing problems, and certain cancers.</p>
    <p>Although BMI can be used for most men and women, it does have some limits:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It may overestimate body fat in athletes and others who have a muscular build.</li>
        <li>It may underestimate body fat in older persons and others who have lost muscle.</li>
    </ul>

<div class="paragraph">
    <h3>BMI Formula</h3>
    <p>The formula for BMI was devised in the 1830s by Belgian mathematician Adolphe Quetelet. 
    BMI is universally expressed in kg/m2. If imperial units are used (pounds and inches) then an additional conversion factor is applied.</p>
    <p>The formula we've listed below is the metric formula, using kilograms (for weight) and meters (for height).</p>
    <h4>BMI = weight (kg) ÷ height2 (m2)</h4>
    <br>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    <h3>BMI Table</h3>
    <p>The BMI score means the following:</p>
    <table class="tableBMI">
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>&nbsp;</th>
            <th scope="col"><strong>BMI</strong></th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Underweight</strong></td>
            <td>
                <div class="center">Below 18.5</div>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Normal</strong></td>
            <td>
                <div class="center">18.5–24.9</div>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Overweight</strong></td>
            <td>
                <div class="center">25.0–29.9</div>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Obesity</strong></td>
            <td>
                <div class="center">30.0 and Above</div>
            </td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <br>
    <p>For people who are considered obese (BMI greater than or equal to 30) or those who are overweight (BMI of 25 to
        29.9) and have two or more risk factors, it is recommended that you lose weight. Even a small weight loss
        (between 5 and 10 percent of your current weight) will help lower your risk of developing diseases associated
        with obesity. People who are overweight, do not have a high waist measurement, and have fewer than two risk
        factors may need to prevent further weight gain rather than lose weight.</p>
    <p>Talk to your doctor to see whether you are at an increased risk and whether you should lose weight. Your doctor
        will evaluate your BMI, waist measurement, and other risk factors for heart disease.</p>
    <p>The good news is even a small weight loss (between 5 and 10 percent of your current weight) will help lower your
        risk of developing those diseases.</p>
